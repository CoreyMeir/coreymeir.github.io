								<h3>My Education</h3>
								<p>From high school, I have taken a large interest in technology, computers and how they work. In my GCSE's I did both Computing and Information Technology. Receiving a B and an A respectively in the subjects. I undertook tasks within my own time on a Raspberry Pi to explore the features and capabilities of it, which is where my passion for coding/programming began.</p>

								<p>I then moved on to do a Level 3 Extended Diploma BTEC in Information Technology and Computing at college. Earning myself a grade of D*D*D*. Completing this course allowed me to see different aspects of the computing world and which I enjoyed the most. Whilst enjoying everything that I did on the course, my programming modules were the ones thay stood out the most to me in terms of what I enjoyed.</p>

								<p>Following the completion of my course, I then did a year of BA(Hons) Esport. I learnt a lot from this course, taking knowledge and experience from some industry leaders. However, I did not find myself as passionate for the subject area as I was in college. Which then lead me onto my course now of BSc(Hons) Computer Games Programming. Which I am now fully enjoying the content being taught to me and thrive to become the best programmer that I can be.

								<h4>My Job Experience</h4>
								<p>I have taken a few job roles on in my spare time to boost my experience in various areas. These include: </p>

								<p>Shift Manager - One Stop Stores LTD.<br>This job involves handling large amounts of money, being responsible for the banking of the shop, and also leading shifts whilst solving any problems that may be encountered. This job has helped to build my leadership, communication, and problem solving skills.

								<p>Website Producer - Integral Bulk Packaging.<br>I produced the website for the starting company around my college hours. Which allowed customers to find a company portfolio and product pages to enquire about the services and products provided.</p>

								<p>Information Technology Technician - NSCG.<br>During the breaks from my studies, I worked as an IT technician over college breaks installing new computer hardware and software across both Newcastle college and Stafford college.</p>
