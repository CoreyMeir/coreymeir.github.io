								<h3>My Job Experience</h3>
								<h4><b>Human Factors Simulation Engineer - RBSL</b> <br></h4>
								<p>Played a key role in the development of a digital twin simulator for an Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) using Unreal Engine 5, interpreting sub-system specifications and system models to accurately replicate system functionality. This includes hosting validation and verification sessions to sign this off with senior stakeholders/customers. This simulator validation process is being presented at the 2025 UK CIEHF conference.<br>
									<br>Represented the company at industry events (DVD, DSET), demonstrating simulation capabilities to VVIPs, ministers, and key stakeholders, as well as hosting high-profile site visits. For these events a specific exhibition AFV simulator was developed and built to facilitate stakeholder engagement. <br>
									<br>During my placement year at RBSL, I was awarded the DSET Intern of the Year Award and Staffordshire University's "Star Placement Student" Award.
