									<h2>VR Project - Unity</h2>
									<p>Here is a guide through my VR Project that I created in my second year of University in Unity. It is designed to work for the Oculus Quest and HTC Vive headsets. </p>

								<h2>The Aim Of The Project</a></h2>
								<p>The purpose of this project was to showcase the skills that I gained within my Virtual Reality module. As well as using my prior experience in Unity to produce multiple systems that utilised
									the OpenXR package for the VR interaction and to also implement game features and UI into the project. I produced this project as a prototype scene to be able to explore the different abilities that would
									be available in a completed game if it were to be expanded into a full sized game with a structured storyline.</p>

								<h2>Name System</h2>
								<p>To create some personalisation to the project, I created a system where before the main scene is loaded, the user can input their name which can then be seen in the main scene. This UI element can be zoomed in and out using the joystick to allow the user to view it at their desired length.</p>

								<h2>Information Tablet</h2>
								<p>This tablet follows the view of the user to allow it to not get lost in the scene, and can be spawned in front of the user at any point by pressing the primary button. It is the main port of call for the user to get help on how to operate around the scene. They can also change the volume within the game, and teleport around the map. </p>

								<h2>Wand System</h2>
								<p>The wand system takes inspiration from the Harry Potter series, and allows the user to cast different spells that interact differently according to which spell is being cast. With a visual and audio cue being implemented for each spell.</p>

								<h2>AK-47</h2>
								<p>Within the shooting range there are two weapons to use, the AK-47 and M1911 pistol which both have different implementations as to how they work. The AK-47 can be grabbed by the handle and shot at the targets, which will display a bullet hole effect upon impact. The second handle of the AK-47 can be grabbed as a two handed weapon and the visual cue of the users hand disappaearing will occur.</p>

								<h2>M1911</h2>
								<p>The second weapon within the shooting range, the M1911 has a system that will only allow the gun to be shot after the slider is cocked back. The gun will shoot blanks until the slider is pulled back, and each magazine has an ammo size that when empty will not allow the user to shoot any bullets.</p>

								<h2>Grenade System</h2>
								<p>The grenade system resembles a real life grenade, in which it will explode after a certain time period once thrown. Once it explodes, it will then affect objects within a radius of the explosion and certain objects in the level will interact from this explosion.</p>
